1. **You**: write quick sort in python
2. **ChatGPT**: Sure, here's an implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python:

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    # Base case: an empty or single-element array is already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Choose the pivot element (can be any element in the array)
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]

    # Partition the array into two sub-arrays based on the pivot
    smaller = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    larger = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    # Recursive calls to sort the sub-arrays
    return quick_sort(smaller) + equal + quick_sort(larger)
```

Let's walk through the code step by step:

1. The `quick_sort` function takes an array `arr` as input.
2. The base case checks if the length of the array is 0 or 1. If true, it means the array is already sorted and we can simply return it.
3. Next, we choose a pivot element. In this implementation, we select the middle element of the array, `pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]`. However, you can choose any element as the pivot.
4. We then partition the array into three sub-arrays: `smaller`, `equal`, and `larger`. The `smaller` array contains elements smaller than the pivot, the `larger` array contains elements larger than the pivot, and the `equal` array contains elements equal to the pivot.
5. We use list comprehensions to create these sub-arrays. The first list comprehension creates the `smaller` array by iterating over `arr` and selecting elements that are smaller than the pivot. Similarly, the second list comprehension creates the `equal` array, and the third list comprehension creates the `larger` array.
6. Finally, we make recursive calls to `quick_sort` on the `smaller` and `larger` sub-arrays, and concatenate the results with the `equal` array in between. This effectively sorts the `arr` array.

To use this `quick_sort` function, you can simply call it with an array as the argument, like this:

```python
my_array = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6]
sorted_array = quick_sort(my_array)
print(sorted_array)
```

This will output: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]`, which is the sorted version of the input array `my_array`.
